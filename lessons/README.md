# Raspberry Pi Pico W Lessons List

## About

In this series of video lessons we will teach absolute beginners how to build projects
using the Raspberry Pi Pico W. We will show how to both code the Pico, and build
circuits. We do not assume you already know this material, and will take you through
each lesson step-by-step. Our goal is for you to then be able to do these types of
projects on your own. This will serve as an excellent curriculum for a STEM program
and is appropriate for use in the public schools, private schools, homeschooling,
or just great for life long learners.
