In this introductory video, I will show you how to get analog output
voltages from the Raspberry Pi Pico W. I will explain that the pico W
simulates analog output voltages using PWM, or Pulse Width Modulation.
I will show how to get the values you need, and will show the actual
waveforms coming from the pico w on an oscilloscope. This class is  for
absolute beginners, and I do not assume you already understand the material
I am presenting. My goal is not to 'Show Off', but to genuinely teach you 
how you can do this type of work and projects on your own. I will show
all work step-by-step, with clear instructions.

## [Raspberry Pi Pico W LESSON 10: Create a Dimmable LED in Micropython](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJhoUklKidc&list=PLGs0VKk2DiYz8js1SJog21cDhkBqyAhC5&index=10)

In this introductory video, I will show you how to create a dimmable LED on
the Pico W using micropython. I will explain that the pico W simulates analog
output voltages using PWM, or Pulse Width Modulation. I will show how to get
the values you need, and will show the actual waveforms coming from the pico w
on an oscilloscope. We connect the PWM signal to a LED, and show we can control
brightness. This class is  for absolute beginners, and I do not assume you already
understand the material I am presenting. My goal is not to 'Show Off', but to
genuinely teach you how you can do this type of work and projects on your own.
I will show all work step-by-step, with clear instructions.
