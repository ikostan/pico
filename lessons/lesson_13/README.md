## Description

In this introductory video, I will show you how to have a user specify
a desired color, and then have the RGB LED turn to that color.  This
class is  for absolute beginners, and I do not assume you already understand
the material I am presenting. My goal is not to 'Show Off', but to genuinely
teach you how you can do this type of work and projects on your own. I will
show all work step-by-step, with clear instructions.
