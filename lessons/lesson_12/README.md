## Description

In this introductory video, I will show you how to understand and use the
Red, Green, Blue (RGB) LED. I will explain the operation of the LED, and
show a simple circuit and program to control the color of the LED in
micropython. This class is  for absolute beginners, and I do not assume
you already understand the material I am presenting. My goal is not to
'Show Off', but to genuinely teach you how you can do this type of work
and projects on your own. I will show all work step-by-step, with clear
instructions.
