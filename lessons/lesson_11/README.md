## Description

In this introductory video, I will show you how to create a dimmable 
LED controlled by a potentiometer in micropython. I will explain that 
the pico W simulates analog output voltages using PWM, or Pulse Width 
Modulation. I will show how to get the values you need, and will show 
the actual waveforms coming from the pico w on an oscilloscope. We 
connect the PWM signal to a LED, and show we can control brightness. 
I also how you can get smoother dimmable action by using exponential 
changes rather than linear changes.This class is  for absolute beginners, 
and I do not assume you already understand the material I am presenting. 
My goal is not to 'Show Off', but to genuinely teach you how you can do 
this type of work and projects on your own. I will show all work step-by-step, 
with clear instructions.
