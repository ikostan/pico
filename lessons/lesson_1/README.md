## Description

This video will walk you through the process of setting up MicroPython 
on your Raspberry Pi Pico W and installing Thonny, a user-friendly development 
environment, on your computer. With Thonny, you’ll be able to communicate directly 
with your Pico W. During this brief introductory session, you’ll create your first 
four programs and be given a homework task to complete. The class is perfect for 
total beginners—no prior experience is needed. My aim is to empower you with 
the skills to tackle these kinds of projects on your own, in a supportive and 
approachable way.
