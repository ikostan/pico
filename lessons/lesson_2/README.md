## Description

In this introductory video, I will show you how to build your first circuit using
the breadboard, and connecting it to the Pico W. We will blink an external LED
from the Pico W. My goal is not to 'Show Off', but to genuinely teach you how you
can do this type of work and projects on your own. Enjoy!
