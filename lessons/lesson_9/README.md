## Description

In this introductory video, I will show you how to get analog output
voltages from the Raspberry Pi Pico W. I will explain that the pico W
simulates analog output voltages using PWM, or Pulse Width Modulation.
I will show how to get the values you need, and will show the actual
waveforms coming from the pico w on an oscilloscope. This class is  for
absolute beginners, and I do not assume you already understand the material
I am presenting. My goal is not to 'Show Off', but to genuinely teach you 
how you can do this type of work and projects on your own. I will show
all work step-by-step, with clear instructions.
