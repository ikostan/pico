In this introductory video, I will show the fundamentals of Binary Numbers.
I will describe our modern computers are all based on the binary number system.
Modern computers are simply very large numbers of very simple on off switches.
I will show how any number can be represented in binary, and hence can be realized
by on off switches. I show how to count in binary, add, subtract and multiply in
binary. I show how to convert numbers from decimal to binary and from binary to
decimal. This class is  for absolute beginners, and I do not assume you already
understand the material I am presenting. My goal is not to 'Show Off', but to
genuinely teach you how you can do this type of work and projects on your own.

In this introductory video, I will show the fundamentals of Binary Numbers.
I will show you my solution to the homework assignment. We will create a 4 bit
binary counter. Modern computers are simply very large numbers of very simple
on off switches. I will show how any number can be represented in binary, and
hence can be realized by on off switches. I show how to count in binary, add,
subtract and multiply in binary. I show how to convert numbers from decimal to
binary and from binary to decimal. This class is  for absolute beginners, and
