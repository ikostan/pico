# [Raspberry Pi Pico W LESSON 7: Controlling 3 LED with a Potentiometer in Micropython](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqvcSnGd_HQ&list=PLGs0VKk2DiYz8js1SJog21cDhkBqyAhC5&index=7)

## Description

In this introductory video, I will show you how to use IF
Statements and conditionals in microPython to turn on and
off three different LED. I will start with simple examples,
and then show how we can control the state of an LED using
If Statements. I will also show how to get input from the
user in micropython using a potentiometer and the analog
read function. This class is  for absolute beginners, and
I do not assume you already understand the material I am
presenting. My goal is not to 'Show Off', but to genuinely
teach you how you can do this type of work and projects on
your own. I will show all work step-by-step, with clear
instructions.
