## Description

In this introductory video, I will show how to read analog voltages
using the Raspberry Pi PIco W. Fortunately, this is much easier than
on the Raspberry PI, sine the Pico has a built in analog to digital
converter. I will show how to read voltages using a potentiometer.
This class is  for absolute beginners, and I do not assume you already
understand the material I am presenting. My goal is not to 'Show Off',
but to genuinely teach you how you can do this type of work and projects
on your own. I will show all work step-by-step, with clear instructions.
