## About

In this series of video lessons we will learn how to
build projects using the Raspberry Pi Pico W. Full Raspberry Pi Pico W
lessons list is [here](https://github.com/ikostan/pico/tree/master/lessons).

### Raspberry Pi Pico W

The Raspberry Pi Pico W is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board
that adds onboard 2.4GHz wireless interfaces (802.11n) while retaining the Pico
form factor. Here are some key features of the Pico W:

- RP2040 microcontroller chip designed by Raspberry Pi in the United Kingdom.
- Dual-core Arm Cortex M0+ processor, with a flexible clock running up to 133 MHz.
- 264kB of SRAM and 2MB of onboard flash memory.
- USB 1.1 with device and host support.
- 26 multi-function GPIO pins, along with SPI, I2C, UART, ADC, and PWM channels.
- Temperature sensor and accelerated floating-point libraries onboard.
- Drag-and-drop programming using mass storage over USB.

The Pico W is a great choice for IoT projects, and it’s priced at just $6!
If you’re interested in C/C++ or MicroPython development, you can get started
with this versatile board. For more details, check out the [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html).
