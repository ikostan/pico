In this series of video lessons we will learn how to
build projects using the Raspberry Pi Pico W. Full Raspberry Pi Pico W
lessons list is [here](https://github.com/ikostan/pico/tree/master/lessons).

The Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller board developed by the
Raspberry Pi Foundation. Released in January 2021, itâ€™s a tiny yet
powerful device that costs less than $5. Unlike the full-fledged
Raspberry Pi computers, the Pico is specifically designed for physical
computing and embedded systems.
