<section id="static-code-analysis">
<h3>Static Code Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#static-code-analysis" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Static code analysis consists of a series of automated checks performed on
source code. A static analysis tool scans code for common known errors and
vulnerabilities, such as memory leaks or buffer overflows. The analysis can
also enforce coding standards.</p>
<section id="tools">
<h4>Tools:<a class="headerlink" href="#tools" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p><strong>1. flake8:</strong> tool for style guide enforcement.</p>
<p>Flake8 is a wrapper around these tools:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PyFlakes</p></li>
<li><p>pycodestyle</p></li>
<li><p>Ned Batchelder’s McCabe script</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. pylint:</strong> analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for
errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for code smells, and can make
suggestions about how the code could be refactored.</p>
<p><strong>3. mypy:</strong> is an optional static type checker for Python that aims to combine
the benefits of dynamic (or “duck”) typing and static typing. Mypy combines the
expressive power and convenience of Python with a powerful type system and
compile-time type checking.</p>
<p><strong>4. Markdown lint:</strong> A tool to check markdown files and flag style issues.</p>

<section id="automated-testing">
<h3>Automated Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#automated-testing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><img alt="Test Automation Pyramid" src="https://github.com/ikostan/pico/blob/master/img/TestAutomationPyramid.png" /></p>
<p>Automation testing is ideal for repetitive tasks and produces more consistent
results than the manual process, as people inevitably risk missing details or
performing checks inconsistently when asked to do the same steps over and over
again.</p>
<section id="unit-testing">
<h4>Unit Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#unit-testing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Unit tests rightly form the basis of the testing pyramid. These tests are
designed to ensure your code works as you expect by addressing the smallest
possible unit of behavior. For teams that have decided to invest in writing unit
tests, developers typically take responsibility for writing them as they write
the code.</p>
</section>
<section id="component-testing">
<h4>Component Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#component-testing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>As the name suggests, Component testing involves analyzing multiple functions
and code modules before they form software. It is a black box testing technique
that evaluates the application without considering the code information.</p>
</section>
<section id="component-testing-vs-unit-testing-key-differences">
<h4>Component Testing vs Unit Testing: Key Differences<a class="headerlink" href="#component-testing-vs-unit-testing-key-differences" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>While Component testing and Unit testing are done in the different stages of
SDLC, they are closely related, but technically both are different. Here’s a table
for you to easily understand Component testing vs Unit testing:</p>
<p><img alt="Component Testing vs Unit Testing" src="https://github.com/ikostan/pico/blob/master/img/component_vs_unit.webp" /></p>
</section>
<section id="integration-testing">
<h4>Integration Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#integration-testing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>With integration tests, you ensure that multiple parts of your software interact
with each other as expected, such as the interaction between some application code
and a database.</p>
</section>
<section id="e2e-testing">
<h4>E2E Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#e2e-testing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Also known as full-stack tests, end-to-end tests look at the entire application.
While they can be run through the GUI, they don’t have to be; an API call can also
exercise multiple parts of the system (although APIs can also be checked with
integration tests). The testing pyramid recommends having a smaller number of
these tests, not only because they take longer to run but also because they tend
to be brittle.</p>
</section>
<section id="system-testing">
<h4>System Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#system-testing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>System Testing is carried out on the whole system in the context of either system
requirement specifications or functional requirement specifications or in contest
of both. System testing tests the design and behavior of the system and also the
expectations of the customer.</p>
</section>
<section id="difference-between-system-testing-and-e2e-testing">
<h4>Difference Between System Testing and E2E Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#difference-between-system-testing-and-e2e-testing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>System Testing is a type of testing that is performed on the complete system or
software application to evaluate its behavior and performance. It is generally
conducted after the completion of the integration testing phase and is carried
out in a production-like environment. The primary objective of System Testing is
to identify defects or bugs that may have been missed during the earlier phases
of testing and ensure that the system meets the specified requirements.</p>
<p>On the other hand, End-to-end Testing is a type of testing that evaluates the
entire software system, including its integration with other systems or external
interfaces. It is typically performed in a simulated production environment and
involves testing the software from the user’s perspective. The objective of
End-to-end Testing is to ensure that the software system meets the customer’s
requirements and expectations and that all components work together seamlessly.</p>
</section>
<section id="manual-testing">
<h4>Manual Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#manual-testing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>It is a technique to test the software that is carried out using the functions
and features of an application. In manual software testing, a tester tests the
software by following a set of predefined test cases. In this testing, testers
make test cases for the codes, test the software, and give the final report
about that software. Manual testing is time-consuming because it is done by
humans, and there is a chance of human errors.</p>
</section>
<section id="test-environments">
<h4>Test Environments<a class="headerlink" href="#test-environments" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Both performance and end-to-end tests require environments that are very similar
to production and may require build test data. For an automated testing regime to
provide confidence in the software under test, it’s important for build tests to
be run in the same way each time, and that includes ensuring test environments
remain consistent between runs (although they should be updated to match production
when changes are applied there).</p>
</section>
<section id="code-coverage">
<h4>Code Coverage<a class="headerlink" href="#code-coverage" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Code coverage is a metric that can help you understand how much of your source is
tested. It’s a very useful metric that can help you assess the quality of your test
suite.</p>
<p><img alt="Codecov Sunburst" src="https://codecov.io/gh/ikostan/pico/graphs/sunburst.svg?token=UV5L6GPUG8" /></p>
<p><strong>Sunburst:</strong> the inner-most circle is the entire project, moving away
from the center are folders then, finally, a single file. The size and
color of each slice is representing the number of statements and the
coverage, respectively.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/code-coverage#:~:text=There%27s%20no%20silver%20bullet%20in%20code%20coverage%2C%20and,coverage%20is%20a%20good%20goal%20to%20aim%20for.">What percentage of coverage should you aim for?</a></p>
<p>There’s no silver bullet in code coverage, and a high percentage of coverage
could still be problematic if critical parts of the application are not being
tested, or if the existing tests are not robust enough to properly capture
failures upfront. With that being said it is <strong>generally accepted that 80% coverage
is a good goal to aim for</strong>. Trying to reach a higher coverage might turn out to
be costly, while not necessary producing enough benefit.</p>
